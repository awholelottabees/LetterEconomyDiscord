# LetterEconomyDiscord
Discord economy bots are great, but what are the real stakes? LetterEconomy Bot has you covered! Including a very realistic stock market (RNG) and cool graphs, LetterEconomy will have your server members fighting to get the basic building blocks of the alphabet, and includes a nice leaderboard!


How to use:

1. Download the file and fill in the variables for serverId, managerId, maxLetters, and tradingChannel.
2. Create a discord bot in the developer portal to use it. Put the bot token at the bottom of the file.
3. Add it to your server.
4. Type le!init to set up everyone in the economy!

   By initializing, you will set the nicknames of everyone who is at a lower permissions level to ".", as they must buy their letters for their nickname. Don't worry, numbers are complementary.
